# ThreeStageExample
Full Library + Example for a three.js stage library

This is a work in progress and essentially just adds independant stages that act like Unity scenes. Each scene has different lists of updateable elements and UI elements as well as seperate UI and regular scene cameras. If you stumbled upon this by accident it really isn't done enough to use, but if you're part of my team have fun.
